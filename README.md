Project Description:  Using data from the Census and teh Ohio Department of Educuation, team members Theodore Smiley Jr, Nancy Dziak, and Juliana (Julie) Novic researched the relationship between school performance and various social and economic factors in a community for public and charter schools.  We selected the three highest population counties in Ohio as our sample and explored the variables of ethnicity, economic disadvantage, and economic opportunity.  

Summary Conclusion:  Charter schools do not serve different communities better than standard public schools.
