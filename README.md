### **Project Description:**  
Using data from the Census and teh Ohio Department of Educuation, team members  researched the relationship between school performance and various social and economic factors in a community for public and charter schools.  We selected the three highest population counties in Ohio as our sample and explored the variables of ethnicity, economic disadvantage, and economic opportunity.  

### **Research Questions:**
* Do charter schools perform better than standard public schools on the Ohio School Board of Education Performance Index Measures?

* Do better performing schools correlate to areas with higher payrolls?

* Are different populations served better by charter schools?

### **Summary Conclusion:** 
Charter shools do not perform better than standard public schools based on the Ohio School Board of Education Performance Measures. Better performing schools do not correlate with areas with higher payrolls.  Charter schools do not serve different communities better than standard public schools.
