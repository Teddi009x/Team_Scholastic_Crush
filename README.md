We propose to explore the relationship between social factors and school performance.  We ask what is the relationship between SES, ethnic composition, and job availability in communities and the performance of schools?   Our sample is divided into charter and private from three major metropolitan areas in Ohio: Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati.   
We will be using census data and school performance data.  The census data is available from the US government and we hope to get the school performance data from the Ohio Board of Education.
